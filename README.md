# Trigonometry-Summative---sin-cos-tan-simulator

For every function so cos sin and tan I used the same logic and applied it to each function, so for cos lets say I use three if statements and I use np. sin, I will just replace the variables with new ones that replicate the same idea and just switch out the np.sin parts to accomodate for cos and tan
